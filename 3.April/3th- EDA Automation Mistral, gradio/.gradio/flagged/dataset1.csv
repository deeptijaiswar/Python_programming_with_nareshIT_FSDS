   - Total number of observations (PassengerId) is 891. Each observation represents a passenger on the Titanic.

   - On average, there were approximately 446 passengers per ship (mean Survived column indicates the percentage of survivors among them). Note that the mean Survived value is 0.3838, suggesting that just over 1/3 of the passengers survived.

   - The passengers belonged to three classes (Pclass) with an average of 2.3086. First-class passengers had the highest Pclass values (1), while third-class passengers had the lowest (3).

   - The ages of passengers ranged from 0.42 to 80, with a mean age of 29.699 and standard deviation of 14.526. Most passengers were adults rather than children, as indicated by the low standard deviation in age.

   - The average number of siblings (SibSp) or other passengers on board who shared the same family with a passenger was 0.523, and the average number of parents or guardians (Parch) was 0.381. A small fraction of passengers had family members traveling with them.

   - The average fare paid by passengers was $32.20, with a large standard deviation of 49.69, indicating significant variation in the cost of travel among passengers.

   These statistics provide valuable insights into the demographics and socioeconomic status of Titanic passengers as well as their likelihood of survival during the disaster. The data can be further analyzed to explore various factors influencing survival rates, such as class, age, sex, family size, etc.",2025-04-25 22:47:02.469984
